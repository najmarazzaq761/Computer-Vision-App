#Computer Vision Streamlit App

I've developed a Streamlit app 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46150dc6-5b52-472d-8513-b92966d5373a

that showcases some computer vision tasks. This project implements the knowledge and skills I acquired from a comprehensive Udemy course on computer vision with Python. The app features the following functionalities:

- **Template Matching**: Calculates feature vectors using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for precise template matching.
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers for accurate face detection.
- **Object Detection**: Implements keypoints matching to detect and identify various objects.

This project is a testament to my growing expertise in computer vision and my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications. I look forward to expanding this app and exploring more advanced techniques in the field of computer vision.

Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback!
